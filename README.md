# AI Gomoku Game -- CIS667 final project
___
## Background
> Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It can be played using the 15×15 board or the 19×19 board.

**Changed rule:** Each player has one additional valid action at each turn.  Instead of placing a new piece, they have the option to choose any one of their pieces on the board, and any one of their opponent's pieces on the board, and then interchange the positions of those two pieces.

**Programming language:** python

**Board size:** 15\*15

**Game process:**
